## Our Inspiration
We wanted to build a simple game that we could idly play during class while listening to lectures, or leave in the background while working on assignments. So we created Marteler le Martlet - a McGill themed clicker style game that allows you to take out your classroom frustrations on Marty the Martlet. It centres around punching Marty the Martlet (McGill's mascot) for feathers, which can be used to buy auto-clickers and clicker multipliers, in order to increase feather amounts.

## How did we make it?
We used Unity and C# as our game engine, and used Procreate and GraphicsGale in order to create the assets and artwork used in-game.

## Challenges
For most of us, it was our first time doing game development, and as such, Unity. It was definitely a learning curve to overcome, but through teamwork and intense documentation reads, we were able to make a product that we're proud of within these 24 hours.

## Accomplishments
We were able to complete all the features we wanted to complete! We were also able to learn about Unity and game development.

## What's next for us?
The next thing we would implement are achievements and random events. Similar to the original Cookie Clicker, these two add-ons would increase player retention and comeback rate.
